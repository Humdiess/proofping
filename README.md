![ProofPing Logo](./src/proofping_frontend/public/images/proofping-logo.png)

Welcome to **ProofPing** — a simple yet powerful decentralized **Proof of Attendance** solution built on the **Internet Computer (ICP)**. ProofPing enables event organizers to securely record and verify participants' attendance on the blockchain.

## 🚀 What is ProofPing?

**ProofPing** allows event organizers to generate **unique event codes**, while participants can claim attendance using those codes. All records are stored immutably on the **ICP blockchain**, ensuring transparency and reliability.

### **How it Works?**
1. **Create Event**: Generate a unique code for your event.  
2. **Claim Attendance**: Participants enter the code and their name.  
3. **Verify Attendance**: Attendance records are publicly accessible with timestamps.

- **Tamper-Proof**: Attendance data is permanently stored on the blockchain.  
- **Simplicity**: Minimal setup with one backend function and a lightweight frontend.  
- **Global Accessibility**: Works for online or offline events anywhere in the world.
